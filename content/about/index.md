**Organizers:** Theodor Wübker, Wolfgang Schröder

We are a student-organized reading group for data systems papers at Leibniz University Hannover. Each week, we discuss a paper on query optimization, machine learning for systems, concurrency control, vector databases, database engines, or other data-related topics. 
Anyone at LUH may join! Please contact one of us at our stud.uni-hannover mail addresses if you are interested. 

The reading group meets once a week at the InfoLounge in the main building. You can find the papers that we discuss under [Papers]({{< relref "papers" >}}). *Note:* This list is subject to change based on the preferences of the attendees.
